/**
 * This class exists to document the Avro-generated classes.
 *
 * The following classes are automatically generated from Avro schemas during the build process:
 * - com.fraudrisk.model.Transaction
 * - com.fraudrisk.model.Metadata
 * - com.fraudrisk.model.Location
 *
 * These classes are created from the .avsc files in src/main/resources/avro/ by the avro-maven-plugin.
 * You won't find these classes in the source code, but they will be available at compile time after
 * the 'generate-sources' Maven phase runs.
 *
 * If you're seeing "cannot resolve import" errors in your IDE, try:
 * 1. Running 'mvn generate-sources' to generate the classes
 * 2. Refreshing your IDE's Maven project
 * 3. Making sure the target/generated-sources directory is marked as a sources root
